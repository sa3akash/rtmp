If you want to change the version of a project in GitHub, it usually involves updating your code and then committing those changes to the repository. Here’s a brief overview of how to do that, focusing on version control best practices:

### Steps to Change Version and Commit

1. **Check Your Current Branch**:
   Make sure you’re on the right branch where you want to make changes.
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

2. **Update Your Code**:
   Make your code changes (e.g., update version numbers in your project files).

3. **Stage Your Changes**:
   Add the files you've changed to the staging area.
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes with a Version Message**:
   Use a commit message that indicates the version change.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Bump version to x.y.z"
   ```

5. **Push Changes to GitHub**:
   Push your updated branch back to the remote repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin [your-branch-name]
   ```

6. **Create a Tag (If Necessary)**:
   If you want to assign a specific version tag to your commit (which is common for releases), you can tag your new version.
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
   ```

7. **Push Tags to GitHub**:
   To make the tag available on GitHub, push your tags.
   ```bash
   git push origin --tags
   ```

### Example Command Sequence

Here's a sample sequence of commands to change the version:

```bash
git checkout main         # Switch to the main branch
git pull                  # Update your local branch
# Make your changes (update version in the files)
git add .                 # Stage changes
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.2.0"  # Commit with message
git push origin main      # Push changes to GitHub
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0" # Tag the version
git push origin --tags    # Push tags to GitHub
```
